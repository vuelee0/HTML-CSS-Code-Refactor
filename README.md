# Code Refactor Starter Code

Description:
With accessibilty standard in mind, I took existing code and make it more accessible. This was done by reducing clutter. Adding comments to code blocks for easier reability for developers. Adding additional attributes to allow any audience even those with disablility to be able to view the website.
